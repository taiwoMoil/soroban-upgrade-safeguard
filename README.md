# Soroban Upgrade Safeguard 🛡️

![Soroban Upgrade Safeguard Demo](assets/demo.png)

A powerful CLI tool to analyze and validate Soroban smart contract upgrades on the Stellar network. It detects breaking changes in storage layout, function signatures, and event schemas before you deploy.

## Features

- **Storage Layout Protection**: Detects field removals, reorderings, and type changes in structs and enums that would corrupt on-chain data.
- **Function Signature Validation**: Flags changes in function names, parameters, and return types that break integration with existing clients/contracts.
- **Event Schema Analysis**: Heuristically identifies event-related types and ensures their structure remains backwards compatible for indexers.
- **Cascading Break Detection**: Uses dependency graphing to track how a change in a low-level type affects all parent structures.
- **Rich CLI Output**: Beautiful, color-coded reports with actionable severity levels (Critical, Warning, Info).
- **CI/CD Friendly**: Exits with a non-zero code if critical breaking changes are detected.
- **Suppression Config**: Acknowledge known, intentional breaking changes (e.g. a planned migration) in a `.safeguard.toml` so they no longer fail the run — while still listing them in the report.
- **Interface Hash**: A stable, order-independent SHA-256 over the normalised spec. Two builds with the same hash expose the same interface, which makes it a cheap cache key and a direct answer to "did this change the interface?".
- **Spec Extraction**: `extract` dumps a single build's decoded interface as JSON, so you can inspect a WASM or archive its interface without separate Stellar tooling.
- **Interface Lockfiles**: Commit a reviewable interface snapshot and make CI fail when a candidate build drifts from it.
- **Re-renderable Reports**: `render` turns a saved JSON report back into text or Markdown, so a stored verdict can be presented any number of ways without the original WASM files.
- **Multi-Format Output**: Emit the same report as JSON, Markdown, and text simultaneously — each to its own file or stdout — in a single run.
- **Watch Mode**: Continuously monitor input WASM files for changes and automatically re-run the comparison on every build.
- **Provenance Metadata**: Every report includes the tool version, a timestamp, and input identifiers for full auditability (`--no-timestamp` for deterministic snapshot testing).
- **Signed Attestations**: Bind reports, artifacts, extracted specs, policy, and verdicts in canonical in-toto statements with offline DSSE verification.
- **GitHub Action**: Reusable action that posts the Markdown report as a PR comment and updates it in-place on subsequent pushes.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

Compare two WASM contract builds to see if the upgrade is safe:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard <OLD_WASM> <NEW_WASM>
```

### Example

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm
```

### Comparing against a deployed contract (RPC baseline)

Fetch the baseline directly from an on-chain contract instead of a local file
— `<CONTRACT_ID>` is fetched over RPC, `<NEW_WASM>` is read from disk:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard \
  --contract-id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --rpc-url <RPC_URL> \
  <NEW_WASM>
```

For example:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard \
  --contract-id CABCD1234... \
  --rpc-url https://soroban-testnet.stellar.org \
  ./wasm/v2.wasm
```

See [Zero-Trust RPC Baseline Retrieval](docs/documentation.md#zero-trust-rpc-baseline-retrieval)
for the hash-verification pipeline, transport security rules, and
authenticated-endpoint guidance to use before pointing this at production,
and the [RPC Security Checklist](docs/rpc-security-checklist.md) for an
operational checklist covering endpoint trust, credentials, and report
retention.

### Validating against captured storage entries

Structural comparison answers whether the *shapes* the new build declares are
compatible with the old ones. Empirical validation answers a narrower, more
concrete question: does the data that actually exists still decode under the new
spec? Point `--empirical-file` at a JSON file of captured ledger/storage entries
to run that check offline, alongside the normal structural analysis:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm \
  --empirical-file ./ledger_snapshot.json
```

The structural findings are still produced in full; the empirical results are
layered onto them. A flagged layout change whose sampled data still decodes is
marked `[CONTRADICTED]` rather than failing the run, while an entry that really
does fail to decode under the new spec fails the run outright, regardless of
`--strict`.

See [Input JSON Format](docs/empirical_validation.md#input-json-format) for the
accepted file shapes, and the
[empirical validation guide](docs/empirical_validation.md) for RPC-based
sampling and the limits of the check.

### Inspecting a single build

```bash
# The full decoded interface as JSON
soroban-upgrade-safeguard extract ./wasm/v1.wasm

# Just the interface hash, for scripting and cache keys
soroban-upgrade-safeguard extract ./wasm/v1.wasm --hash-only
```

### Pinning an interface with a lockfile

Generate a lockfile from the build whose public interface you intend to protect:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard lockfile ./wasm/v1.wasm \
  --output ./wasm/contract.interface.lock.json
```

Commit the resulting JSON file. It contains the interface hash and the structured
functions and user-defined types, with stable ordering and without build-specific
paths. When an interface change is intentional, regenerate it with `--force` and
review the lockfile diff as part of the same change:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard lockfile ./wasm/v2.wasm \
  --output ./wasm/contract.interface.lock.json --force
```

Use the committed lockfile as a CI gate for a candidate build:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/candidate.wasm \
  --interface-lockfile ./wasm/contract.interface.lock.json \
  --format json
```

The command exits successfully when the exported interface matches. A drift exits
non-zero and reports the same categorized findings as a normal two-build comparison.
Lockfile checks cover the exported interface only; use the regular comparison mode
for environment metadata, host imports, runtime surface, storage schemas, or
empirical validation.

### Re-rendering a saved report

`render` accepts either a saved JSON report path or `-` to read the JSON from
stdin, and prints it as `text` (the default) or `markdown` — `json` is not a
render target, since re-rendering a saved JSON document as JSON would just be
a copy.

```bash
# From a saved file
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm --format json > report.json
soroban-upgrade-safeguard render report.json --format markdown

# From stdin, piped straight from a comparison run
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm --format json \
  | soroban-upgrade-safeguard render - --format text
```

### Signing and verifying reports

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard attest report.json \
  --old-wasm old.wasm --new-wasm new.wasm \
  --private-key signing-key.pk8 --key-id release-key \
  --output report.dsse.json

soroban-upgrade-safeguard verify-attestation report.dsse.json \
  --trusted-key release-key=public-key.raw \
  --report report.json --old-wasm old.wasm --new-wasm new.wasm
```

See the [attestation guide](docs/attestations.md) for predicate details,
resolved policy binding, offline verification, and key-handling guidance.

Use `-` for one positional WASM to read it from stdin, for example when a build
artifact is piped from another command:

```bash
cat ./wasm/v2.wasm | soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm -
```

Only one positional input may be `-`; using `-` for both `OLD_WASM` and
`NEW_WASM` is rejected because stdin can only be consumed once.

### Suppressing known breaking changes

If a breaking change is deliberate and already accounted for, list it in a
`.safeguard.toml` so it no longer fails the run. Matching is exact (by
`category` and `target`), and suppressed findings are still shown in the report,
marked `[SUPPRESSED]`:

```toml
[[suppress]]
category = "Struct Field Removed"
target   = "ConfigData.threshold"
reason   = "Planned storage migration in v2."
```

The tool auto-loads `.safeguard.toml` from the current directory, or use
`--config <PATH>` to point at another file. See
[`.safeguard.example.toml`](.safeguard.example.toml) for a documented template
and the [documentation](docs/documentation.md#suppressing-known-breaking-changes)
for the full `target` convention.

#### Ignoring configuration entirely

Config is discovered automatically, from several places in turn: `--config`,
then the `SOROBAN_SAFEGUARD_CONFIG` environment variable, then a
`.safeguard.toml` in the current directory, then — with `--search-parent-config`
— an ancestor directory. In batch mode a manifest may name one too.

`--no-config` turns all of that off and runs with no suppressions at all. It is
an escape hatch, not another layer in the chain: it outranks every source above,
the manifest included, so nothing in the environment or the working tree can
quietly re-enable a suppression.

```bash
# Judge the upgrade on the tool's own rules, ignoring any ambient .safeguard.toml
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm --no-config
```

That makes it the flag to reach for when a run has to be reproducible or
self-contained — verifying what a report would look like with nothing
acknowledged, reproducing a CI result on a developer machine that has its own
`.safeguard.toml`, or auditing whether a gate passes on its merits rather than
on its suppressions.

`--no-config` and `--config <PATH>` are **mutually exclusive**: passing both is
rejected as a command-line error rather than resolved by precedence, since one
asks for a specific config and the other for none, and guessing which was meant
is exactly the wrong behavior for a safety gate. `--search-parent-config` is
rejected alongside `--no-config` for the same reason. To run against a known
config instead of the ambient one, pass `--config <PATH>` on its own.
### Output format

By default, and whenever `--format` is omitted, the report prints as
colored, human-readable **text**. Select another format explicitly with
`--format`:

```bash
# JSON, for scripting and CI
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm --format json

# Markdown, for PR descriptions and comments
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm --format markdown
```

### Multiple output formats

Emit the same report in several formats and destinations in a single run:

```bash
# Write JSON to a file, Markdown to another, and print text to stdout
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm \
  --output json:report.json \
  --output markdown:report.md

# Write to stdout only (default)
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm

# Explicit stdout format with file output
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm \
  --format text \
  --output json:ci-report.json
```

### Quiet output

`--quiet` suppresses everything the tool narrates *about* the run: the banner and
separator lines, the per-file loading and spec-summary lines, config-discovery
notes, batch pair headers, and the `report written to <path>` confirmations.

It does not remove anything from the report. Every format you selected is still
produced in full, with the same findings, to the same destination. The verdict
and the exit code are also unchanged — `--quiet` only decides what gets narrated,
never what gets analyzed, reported, or gated on.

```bash
# CI: only the JSON report reaches the log, with no surrounding progress text
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm \
  --format json --quiet

# Still exits non-zero on breaking changes, so this remains a working gate
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm \
  --quiet --output json:report.json || echo "upgrade rejected"
```

Note that progress output already avoids stdout whenever stdout carries a
machine-readable report — with `--format json` it is written to stderr instead.
`--quiet` goes further and silences it on both streams, which is what you want
when a CI log should contain the report and nothing else.

### Watch mode

Re-run the comparison automatically when input files change:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm --watch
```

Watch mode:
- Monitors both WASM files for changes using filesystem notifications.
- Debounces rapid writes (e.g. from build tools) with a 300ms window.
- Clears the terminal screen and re-renders the report on each change.
- Handles transient missing files gracefully (e.g. build tools that delete and recreate).
- Keeps the process running regardless of comparison verdict (non-zero exit codes do NOT exit the watcher).
- Exit with `Ctrl+C`.

Watch mode also works at repository scale, for both directory comparisons and
batch manifests. In that case it builds an input dependency graph instead of
re-running the whole batch on every write:

```bash
# watch a whole directory comparison
soroban-upgrade-safeguard --old-dir ./artifacts/v1 --new-dir ./artifacts/v2 --watch

# watch a batch manifest (TOML or JSON, `include` chain included)
soroban-upgrade-safeguard --manifest release.toml --watch
```

For a batch, every pair's inputs — its two WASM builds, its storage schemas,
its suppression config, and the manifest file(s) that defined it — are tracked.
Filesystem events are normalized and debounced, then mapped to only the pairs
that actually read the touched file. Untouched pairs keep their last known
verdict, and the full, deterministically ordered aggregate report is re-rendered
after each cycle. Specifically:

- A **WASM/schema/config** change re-analyzes exactly the pairs that read it.
- A **manifest edit** re-resolves the composition (pairs may appear, disappear,
  or pick up new settings) and re-analyzes only the pairs whose identity or
  settings changed.
- A **directory scan** change re-derives the pair set: a removed artifact becomes
  a Critical gap, a restored one heals, a newly added pair appears.
- **Atomic replacement** (a build tool writing to a temp file then renaming it
  into place, possibly several times in quick succession) is coalesced into a
  single cycle, and the watch process's own report/status writes are ignored so
  it never reacts to itself.
- A pair that fails to load or analyze is isolated as its own error while every
  unrelated contract retains its result; a transiently missing or mid-edit input
  is reported without terminating the watcher.

Use `--watch-status-file <path>` with any watch mode to have the process write
an atomically-updated JSON status document (state, cycle number, timestamps,
verdict) that an external build system or service manager can poll cheaply.

### Comparing two directories of builds

When the old and new builds of several contracts sit in two directories, compare
them all in one run:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard --old-dir ./artifacts/v1 --new-dir ./artifacts/v2
```

Pairs are formed by file name: every `.wasm` file in the old directory is
matched with the file of the same name in the new directory, and the file stem
becomes the contract's name in the report.

```text
artifacts/
├── v1/                 ├── v2/
│   ├── token.wasm      │   ├── token.wasm     → pair "token"
│   └── vault.wasm      │   └── vault.wasm     → pair "vault"
```

An old artifact with no file of that name in the new directory is not skipped:
it is reported as a Critical finding under its own name — a contract that
disappeared from a release is exactly the kind of accident this gate exists to
catch — so the run fails. The reverse case, a new artifact with no old
counterpart, has nothing to compare against; it is listed as a warning on stderr
and does not affect the verdict.

### Comparing many contracts at once

A manifest lists the pairs one run compares. The minimal form is one
`[[pairs]]` entry per contract, each naming an old build, a new build, and the
name the pair reports under:

```toml
# release.toml
[[pairs]]
name = "token"
old  = "artifacts/v1/token.wasm"
new  = "artifacts/v2/token.wasm"

[[pairs]]
name = "vault"
old  = "artifacts/v1/vault.wasm"
new  = "artifacts/v2/vault.wasm"
```

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard --manifest release.toml
```

Relative paths resolve against the directory of the manifest that wrote them, not
the working directory, so the file above works from anywhere in the repository.

Beyond that, a manifest can share settings across pairs, pull in other manifests,
and hold a single contract to a stricter bar — see
[Batch Manifests](docs/batch_manifests.md) for the full schema:

```toml
include = ["common/policy.toml"]   # share a policy across manifests

[defaults]
base_dir = "artifacts"             # relative paths resolve against the manifest
strict   = false

[[pairs]]
old    = "token_v1.wasm"
new    = "token_v2.wasm"
name   = "token"
old_storage_schema = "schemas/token_v1.json"
new_storage_schema = "schemas/token_v2.json"
strict = true                      # this one contract is held to a stricter bar

[pairs.policy]
gate_event_indexer = true
```

Settings resolve as `built-in < CLI < included defaults < root [defaults] < pair`,
except `--strict`/`--explain`, which a manifest may enable but never disable.
To see exactly where each value came from without running any comparison:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard --manifest release.toml --explain-manifest
```

#### Naming each pair

`name` gives a pair a stable identity in the results. It is optional — when
omitted, a pair is identified by the file name of its `new` build, so
`token_v2.wasm` reports as `token_v2.wasm`:

```toml
[[pairs]]
old  = "token_v1.wasm"
new  = "token_v2.wasm"
name = "token"
```

That name is what every batch output keys off:

- the summary line and the `=== Contract: token ===` detail heading in text output;
- the summary table row and the `## Details: token` heading in Markdown;
- the `results[].name` field in JSON;
- the `::group::token` log group in GitHub Actions output;
- the file name written under `--per-contract-output-dir`.

It also identifies a pair that *fails*: a pair whose comparison errors is
reported under its name rather than a path, so the failing entry is
recognisable at a glance. Because identity has to be unambiguous, two pairs
resolving to the same name is a hard error, raised before any comparison runs
and naming both manifests involved — which is the usual reason to set `name`
explicitly, since two teams' `v2.wasm` files would otherwise collide.

For a stable identifier meant for tooling rather than people — one that survives
a name being reworded — use the separate [`id`](docs/batch_manifests.md#pair-ids)
field.

See [Batch Manifests](docs/batch_manifests.md) for the full schema, includes,
schema coverage rules, path rules, and JSON provenance.

### Deterministic output for snapshot testing

By default, every report includes a timestamp in the provenance metadata for full auditability. Use `--no-timestamp` to suppress only the provenance timestamp, enabling reproducible snapshot tests and deterministic artifact generation:

```bash
soroban-upgrade-safeguard ./wasm/v1.wasm ./wasm/v2.wasm \
  --format json --no-timestamp > report.json
```

This flag omits only the provenance timestamp field from the report metadata. All other timestamp information (such as build timestamps embedded in the WASM itself) remains unchanged. The normal timestamped behavior is the default and should be used for production workflows where auditability is important.

### GitHub Action

A reusable GitHub Action is provided to run the safeguard tool and post
the Markdown report as a pull request comment. It updates the comment
in-place on subsequent pushes.

**Workflow example** (`.github/workflows/safeguard-report.yml`):

```yaml
name: Soroban Upgrade Safety Report

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'wasm/**/*.wasm'

jobs:
  safeguard-report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      pull-requests: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install Rust
        uses: dtolnay/rust-toolchain@stable
      - name: Build safeguard
        run: cargo build --release
      - name: Add to PATH
        run: echo "${{ github.workspace }}/target/release" >> "$GITHUB_PATH"
      - name: Run Soroban Upgrade Safeguard
        uses: ./.github/actions/soroban-upgrade-safeguard
        with:
          old-wasm: ./wasm/v1.wasm
          new-wasm: ./wasm/v2.wasm
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          args: --strict --explain
```

The action uses the GitHub CLI (`gh`) to manage comments. It searches for
an existing comment containing the hidden marker
`<!-- soroban-upgrade-safeguard-report -->` and updates it, or creates a new
one if none exists. The action requires `pull-requests: write` permission.

If run on a forked PR without write permissions, the action logs a warning
and exits gracefully — the report is still generated but the comment is not
posted.

## How it Works

The tool parses the `contractspecv0` custom sections from both WASM files, decodes the XDR representations of the contract's interface, and performs a deep structural comparison. It builds a type dependency map to identify when a simple change in a shared struct might cascade into breaking multiple storage entries.

## Severity Levels

- **🔴 CRITICAL**: Breaking changes that WILL cause data corruption, serialization panics, or broken integrations. **Do not deploy.**
- **🟡 WARNING**: Changes that might affect external systems but won't necessarily corrupt local storage (e.g., adding elective parameters if supported).
- **🔵 INFO**: Informational logs about additions or non-breaking modifications.
